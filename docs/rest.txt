* mldonkey REST attempt
This branch is an attempt at a json rest interface.

currently you only get a json dump of the downloads and their
statistics at:

http://localhost:4080/api/json/vd

** tentative plan
*** iteration 1
- authenticate using plain http, just as is already done
- submit a download, mostly like it already works
- expose the download information over json
*** iteration 2
- more primitives
*** iteration 3
- rest callbacks, when a commit is done 
*** iteration future
also expose XML, or whatever people like to consume these days
